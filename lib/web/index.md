# Back Yard Exchange

American back yards are one of the most under-utilized
and valuable resources on the planet. Many Americans mainly use
their valuable urban space as a cache for their pet waste.

What if every American yard could be fully utilized?  Your yard could become:

* a valuable rental property for passive income
* a home for an individual or small family (tiny house, guest house, etc.)
* with high-yield or high-tech systems like permaculture, aquaponics or 
aeroponics, a productive and significant source of food
* a makerspace/workshop/hangout for a local club
