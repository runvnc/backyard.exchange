  <h1>Back Yard Exchange</h1>

  <p>American back yards are one of the most under-utilized
and valuable resources on the planet. Many Americans mainly use
their valuable urban space as a cache for their pet waste.</p>

<p>What if every American yard could be fully utilized?  Your yard could become:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a valuable rental property for passive income</li>
  <li>a home for an individual or small family (tiny house, guest house, etc.)</li>
  <li>with high-yield or high-tech systems like permaculture, aquaponics or 
  aeroponics, a productive and significant source of food</li>
  <li> a makerspace/workshop/hangout for a local club</li>
